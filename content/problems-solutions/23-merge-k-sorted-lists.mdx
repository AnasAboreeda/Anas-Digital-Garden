# 23. Merge K Sorted Lists

## Problem Statement

## Solution

```java
/*
 * @lc app=leetcode id=23 lang=java
 *
 * [23] Merge k Sorted Lists
 */

// @lc code=start
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {

    private ListNode mergeTowLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode prev = dummy;

        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
                prev.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                prev.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
            prev = prev.next;
        }

        if (l1 != null) {
            prev.next = l1;
        }

        if (l2 != null) {
            prev.next = l2;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }

    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if (lists.length > 0) {
            ListNode res = lists[0];

            for (int i = 1; i < lists.length; i++) {
                res = mergeTowLists(res, lists[i]);
            }

            return res;
        }

        return new ListNode().next;
    }
}
// @lc code=end
```

## Time Complexity

O(N*K) where

K is the largest List length

N length of the lists array

## Space Complexity

O(1)

## Explanation

Since our task involves multiple lists, you should divide the problem into multiple tasks, starting with the problem of combining two lists at a time. Then, you should combine the result of those first two lists with the third list, and so on, until the very last one is reached.

Let's discuss how we will implement this process:

1. Consider the first list as the result, and store it in a variable.
2. Traverse the list of lists, starting from the second list, and combine it with the list we stored as a result. The result should get stored in the same variable.
3. When combining the two lists, like `l1` and `l2`, maintain a `prev` pointer that points to a dummy node.
4. If the value for list `l1` is less than or equal to the value for list `l2`, connect the previous node to `l1` and increment `l1`. Otherwise, do the same but for list `l2`.
5. Keep repeating the above step until one list points to a `null` value.
6. Connect the non-null list to the merged one and return.
