# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

## Problem Statement

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/03/closestplane1.jpg)

```
Input: points = [[13-22]], k = 1
Output: [[22]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[22]].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[335-1-24]], k = 2
Output: [[33-24]]
Explanation: The answer [[2433]] would also be accepted.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= points.length <= 104`
- `104 < xi, yi < 104`

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> heap = new PriorityQueue<>(
					(a, b) -> Double.compare(calculateDistance(a), calculateDistance(b))
				);

        for(int i = 0; i < points.length; i ++) {
            heap.add(points[i]);
        }

        int[][] result = new int[k][];

        k--;

        while(k >=0 && !heap.isEmpty()) {
            result[k] = heap.remove();
            k--;
        }

        return result;
    }

    private Double calculateDistance(int[] point) {
        return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(point[0], 2) + Math.pow(point[1], 2));
    }
}
```
