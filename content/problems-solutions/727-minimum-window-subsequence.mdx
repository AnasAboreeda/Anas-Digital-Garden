# 727 Minimum Window Subsequence

## Problem Statement

Given strings `S` and `T`, find the minimum (contiguous) **substring** `W` of `S`, so that `T` is a **subsequence** of `W`.

If there is no such window in `S` that covers all characters in `T`, return the empty string `""`. If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

**Example :**

**Input:**  
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"  
**Output:** "bcde"  
**Explanation:**  
There are many substrings with "bde" but the smallest amongst them is "bcde" and "bdde" of length 4. Out of these 2, "bcde" occurs first, Hence it is the answer.

## Solution

```javascript
function minWindow(str1, str2) {
	// Save the size of str1 and str2
	let sizeStr1 = str1.length,
		sizeStr2 = str2.length;

	// Initialize length to a very large number (infinity)
	let length = Infinity;
	// Initialize pointers to zero and the minSubsequence to an empty string
	let indexS1 = 0,
		indexS2 = 0,
		minSubsequence = "";

	// Process every character of str1
	while (indexS1 < sizeStr1) {
		// Check if the character pointed by indexS1 in str1
		// is the same as the character pointed by indexS2 in str2
		if (str1[indexS1] == str2[indexS2]) {
			// If the pointed character is the same
			// in both strings increment indexS2
			indexS2++;
			// Check if indexS2 has reached the end of str2
			if (indexS2 == sizeStr2) {
				// At this point the str1 contains all characters of str2
				let start = indexS1,
					end = indexS1 + 1;
				// Initialize start to the index where all characters of
				// str2 were present in str1
				indexS2--;
				// Decrement pointer indexS2 and start a reverse loop
				while (indexS2 >= 0) {
					// Decrement pointer indexS2 until all characters of
					// str2 are found in str1
					if (str1[start] == str2[indexS2]) indexS2 -= 1;
					// Decrement start pointer everytime to find the
					// starting point of the required subsequence
					start -= 1;
				}
				start++;

				// Check if length of sub sequence pointed
				// by start and end pointers is less than current min length
				if (end - start < length) {
					// Update length if current sub sequence is shorter
					length = end - start;
					// Update minimum subsequence string
					// to this new shorter string
					minSubsequence = str1.substring(start, end);
				}

				// Set indexS1 to start to continue checking in str1
				// after this discovered subsequence
				indexS1 = start
				indexS2 = 0
			}
		}
		// Increment pointer indexS1 to check next character in str1
		indexS1++;
	}
	return minSubsequence;
}

function main() {
	let str1 = [
		"abcdebdde",
		"fgrqsqsnodwmxzkzxwqegkndaa",
		"qwewerrty",
		"aaabbcbq",
		"zxcvnhss",
		"alpha",
		"beta",
		"asd",
		"abcd",
	];
	let str2 = ["bde", "kzed", "werty", "abc", "css", "la", "ab", "as", "pp"];

	for (let i = 0; i < str1.length; i++) {
		console.log(
			i + 1 + ". \tInput string: (" + str1[i] + ", " + str2[i] + ")"
		);
		console.log("\tSubsequence string:", minWindow(str1[i], str2[i]));
		console.log("-".repeat(100));
	}
}

main();
