# 49. Group Anagrams

## Problem Statement

## Solution

```java
class Solution {

    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> anagramsMap = new HashMap();
        int[] freq = new int[26];

        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(freq, 0);
            String currentStr = strs[i];

            for (int j = 0; j < currentStr.length(); j++) {
                int letterIndex = currentStr.charAt(j) - 'a';
                freq[letterIndex] += 1;
            }

            String anagramKey = Arrays
                .stream(freq)
                .mapToObj(String::valueOf)
                .reduce("#", (subtotal, element) -> subtotal + "#" + element);

            List<String> currentValues;
            if (anagramsMap.containsKey(anagramKey)) {
                currentValues = anagramsMap.get(anagramKey);
            } else {
                currentValues = new ArrayList<>();
            }
            currentValues.add(currentStr);
            anagramsMap.put(anagramKey, currentValues);
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(anagramsMap.values());
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

O(n * k)

We are counting each letter for each string in a list, so the time complexity will be *O*(*n*×*k*).

## Space Complexity

Since every string is being stored as a value in the dictionary whose size can be **n**, and the size of the string can be **k**, so space complexity is O(n \times k)*O*(*n*×*k*).

## Explanation

Let's see how we might implement this functionality:

1. For each title, compute a 26-element vector. Each element in this vector represents the frequency of an English letter in the corresponding title. This frequency count will be represented as a string delimited with `#` characters. For example, `abbccc` will be represented as `#1#2#3#0#0#0…#0`. This mapping will generate identical vectors for strings that are anagrams.
2. Use this vector as a key to insert the titles into a Hash Map. All anagrams will be mapped to the same entry in this Hash Map. When a user searches a word, compute the 26-element English letter frequency vector based on the word. Search in the Hash Map using this vector and return all the map entries.
3. Store the vector of the calculated character counts in the same Hash Map as a *key* and assign the respective set of anagrams as its *value*.
4. Return the values of the Hash Map, since each value will be an individual set.
