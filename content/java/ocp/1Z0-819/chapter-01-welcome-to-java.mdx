# Chapter 01 - Welcome to Java

## Exam Essentials

- **Identify benefits of Java.** Benefits of Java include object-oriented design, encapsulation, platform independence, robustness, simplicity, security, multithreading, and backward compatibility.
- **Define common acronyms.**
    - The JDK stands for Java Development Kit and contains the compiler and JVM launcher.
    - The JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine, and it runs bytecode.
    - API is an application programming interface, which is code that you can call.
- **Be able to write code using a main() method**. A main() method is usually written as `public static void main(String[] args)`. Arguments are referenced starting with args[0]. Accessing an argument that wasn't passed in will cause the code to throw an exception.
- **Understand the effect of using packages and imports**. Packages contain Java classes. Classes can be imported by class name or wildcard. Wildcards do not look at subdirectories. In the event of a conflict, class name imports take precedence.
- **Be able to recognize misplaced statements in a class**. Package and import statements are optional. If present, both go before the class declaration in that order. Fields and methods are also optional and are allowed in any order within the class declaration.
