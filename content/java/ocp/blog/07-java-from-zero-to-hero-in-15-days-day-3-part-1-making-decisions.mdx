# 07 Java — from Zero to Hero in 15 Days — Day 3 - part 1 - Making Decisions

## The _if else_ Statement

It helps your code to branch between multiple options with boolean evaluation of a condition for each branch.

```java
if(hourOfDay < 11) {
    System.out.println("Good Morning");
} else if(hourOfDay < 15) {
    System.out.println("Good Afternoon");
} else {
    System.out.println("Good Evening");
}
```

### Shortening Code with Pattern Matching

- Java 16 officially introduced pattern matching with `if` statements and the `instanceof` operator.
- _Pattern matching_ is a technique of controlling program flow that only executes a section of code that meets certain criteria.
- It is used in conjunction with `if` statements for greater program control.

> If pattern matching is new to you, be careful not to confuse it with the Java `Pattern` class or regular expressions (_regex_). While pattern matching can include the use of regular expressions for filtering, they are unrelated concepts.

Here is an example of using Pattern matching

```java
// This method is WITHOUT using Pattern matching
void compareIntegers(Number number) {
    if(number instanceof Integer) {
        Integer data = (Integer)number;
        System.out.print(data.compareTo(5));
    }
}

// This method is WITH using Pattern matching
void compareIntegers(Number number) {
    if(number instanceof Integer data) {
        System.out.print(data.compareTo(5));
    }
}
```

The variable `data` in this example is referred to as the _pattern variable_.  
Notice that this code also avoids any potential `ClassCastException` because the cast operation is executed only if the implicit `instanceof` operator returns `true`.

### Pattern Variables and Expressions

Pattern matching includes expressions that can be used to filter data out, such as in the following example:

```java
void printIntegersGreaterThan5(Number number) {
    if(number instanceof Integer data && data.compareTo(5)>0)
        System.out.print(data);
}
```

We can apply a number of filters, or patterns, so that the `if` statement is executed only in specific circumstances. Notice that we're using the pattern variable in an expression in the same line in which it is declared.

### Subtypes

The type of the pattern variable must be a subtype of the variable on the left side of the expression. It also cannot be the same type. This rule does not exist for traditional `instanceof` operator expressions, though. Consider the following two uses of the `instanceof` operator:

```java
Integer value = 123;
if(value instanceof Integer) {}
if(value instanceof Integer data) {}  // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

### Flow Scoping

- The compiler applies flow scoping when working with pattern matching.
- _Flow scoping_ means the variable is only in scope when the compiler can definitively determine its type.
- Flow scoping is unlike any other type of scoping in that it is not strictly hierarchical like instance, class, or local scoping.
- It is determined by the compiler based on the branching and flow of the program.

Given this information, can you see why the following does not compile?

```java
void printIntegersOrNumbersGreaterThan5(Number number) {
    if(number instanceof Integer data || data.compareTo(5)>0)
        System.out.print(data);
}
```

If the input does not inherit `Integer`, the `data` variable is undefined. Since the compiler cannot guarantee that `data` is an instance of `Integer`, `data` is not in scope, and the code does not compile.

```java
void printIntegerTwice(Number number) {
    if (number instanceof Integer data)
        System.out.print(data.intValue());
    System.out.print(data.intValue());  // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```

Since the input might not have inherited Integer, data is no longer in scope after the if statement. Oh, so you might be thinking that the pattern variable is then only in scope inside the if statement, right? Well, not exactly! Consider the following example that does compile:

```java
void printOnlyIntegers(Number number) {
    if (!(number instanceof Integer data))
        return;
    System.out.print(data.intValue());
}

// This is equivalent to

void printOnlyIntegers(Number number) {
    if (number instanceof Integer data)
        System.out.print(data.intValue());
    else
        return;
}
```

It might surprise you to learn this code does compile. Eek! What is going on here? The method returns if the input does not inherit `Integer`. This means that when the last line of the method is reached, the input must inherit `Integer`, and therefore `data` stays in scope even after the `if` statement ends.
