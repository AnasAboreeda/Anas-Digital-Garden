# 03 Java — From Zero to Hero in 15 Days — Day 1 - part 3 - Data Types

## Data Types

Java applications contain two types of data: primitive types and reference types.

## 1. Primitive Types

* Java has 8 built-in data types, referred to as the Java *primitive types*.

* A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a number or character

* All Java objects are just a complex collection of these primitive data types.

Here are the 8 primitive data types:

    | Keyword | Type                        | Min Value      | Max Value     | Default Value | Example |
    |---------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
    | Boolean | True Or False               | N/a            | N/a           | False         | True    |
    | Byte    | 8-Bit Integral Value        | -128           | 127           | 0             | 123     |
    | Short   | 16-Bit Integral Value       | -32,768        | 32,767        | 0             | 123     |
    | Int     | 32-Bit Integral Value       | -2,147,483,648 | 2,147,483,647 | 0             | 123     |
    | Long    | 64-Bit Integral Value       | -2^63          | 2^63 – 1      | 0L            | 123L    |
    | Float   | 32-Bit Floating-Point Value | N/a            | N/a           | 0.0f          | 123.45f |
    | Double  | 64-Bit Floating-Point Value | N/a            | N/a           | 0.0           | 123.456 |
    | Char    | 16-Bit Unicode Value        | 0              | 65,535        | \u0000        | 'A'     |
>  Is String a Primitive?
>  No, it is not. That said, String is often mistaken for a ninth primitive because Java includes built-in support for String literals and operators.

Notes on the primitive data types:

* The byte, short, int, and long types are used for integer values without decimal points.

* All of the numeric types are signed and reserve one of their bits to cover a negative range. For example, instead of byte covering 0 to 255 (or even 1 to 256) it actually covers -128 to 127.

* A float requires the letter f or F following the number so Java knows it is a float. Without an f or F, Java interprets a decimal value as a double.

* A long requires the letter l or L following the number so Java knows it is a long. Without an l or L, Java interprets a number without a decimal point as an int in most scenarios.

* short vs. char: both are stored as integral types with the same 16-bit length. The primary difference is that short is *signed*, which means it splits its range across the positive and negative integers. Alternatively, char is *unsigned*, which means its range is strictly positive, including 0.

### Working with Numbers/Literals

Here are some code examples of working with numbers in Java

    long max = 3123456789;  // DOES NOT COMPILE because it's out of range of int (the default is int)
    long max = 3123456789L;  // Now Java knows it is a long
    int octaNo = 017;
    int hexaNo = 0xff;
    int binaryNo = 0B10;

You can add an underscore to numbers to make them more readable e.g.

    int million1 = 1000000;
    int million2 = 1_000_000;
    
    // Notes on underscore position
    double notAtStart = _1000.00;          // DOES NOT COMPILE
    double notAtEnd = 1000.00_;            // DOES NOT COMPILE
    double notByDecimal = 1000_.00;        // DOES NOT COMPILE
    double annoyingButLegal = 1_00_0.0_0;  // Ugly, but compiles
    double reallyUgly = 1__________2;      // Also compiles

## 2. Reference Types

A *reference type* refers to an object (an instance of a class) e.g.

    // Here we are creating a reference variable of type String
    String greeting; 
    
    // Here we are assigning this reference to a new object
    greeting = new String("How are you?");

### Primitives vs. Reference Types

* All the primitive types have lowercase type names. All classes that come with Java begin with uppercase.

* Reference types can be used to call methods, assuming the reference is not null. Primitives do not have methods declared on them.

* Reference types can be assigned null, which means they do not currently refer to an object. Primitive types will give you a compiler error if you attempt to assign them null.

    // In this example, we can call a method on reference since it is of a reference type. 
    // You can tell length is a method because it has () after it.
    
    String reference = "hello";
    int len = reference.length();
    int bad = len.length(); // DOES NOT COMPILE as it's on a premitive type
    
    // Assinging null to premitive is not allowed
    int value = null;   // DOES NOT COMPILE
    String name = null;

### Wrapper Classes

Each primitive type has a wrapper class, which is an object type that corresponds to the primitive.

    | Primitive type | Wrapper class | Wrapper class inherits Number? | Example of creating        |
    |----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
    | boolean        | Boolean       | No                             | Boolean.valueOf(true)      |
    | byte           | Byte          | Yes                            | Byte.valueOf((byte) 1)     |
    | short          | Short         | Yes                            | Short.valueOf((short) 1)   |
    | int            | Integer       | Yes                            | Integer.valueOf(1)         |
    | long           | Long          | Yes                            | Long.valueOf(1)            |
    | float          | Float         | Yes                            | Float.valueOf((float) 1.0) |
    | double         | Double        | Yes                            | Double.valueOf(1.0)        |
    | char           | Character     | No                             | Character.valueOf('c')     |

### String blocks

You can declare string blocks using ””” e.g.

    String oneLine = "This is one line string";
    
    String multipleLines = """
        This is a string
        in multiple lines
        """;
