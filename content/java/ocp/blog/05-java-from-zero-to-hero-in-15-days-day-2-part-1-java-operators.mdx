# 05 Java — from Zero to Hero in 15 Days — Day 2 - part 1 - Java Operators

A Java _operator_ is a special symbol that can be applied to a set of variables, values, or literals—referred to as operands—and that returns a result. The term _operand_, which we use throughout this chapter, refers to the value or variable the operator is being applied to.

## Types of Operators

Java supports three flavors of operators: unary, binary, and ternary. These types of operators can be applied to one, two, or three operands, respectively.

## Operator Precedence

Determining which operators are evaluated in what order is referred to as _operator precedence_. In this manner, Java more closely follows the rules for mathematics.

```java
var perimeter = 2 * height + 2 * length;

// how the compiler evaluates this expression
// The multiplication operator (`*`) has a higher precedence than the addition operator (`+`),

var perimeter = ((2 * height) + (2 * length));

```

## Order of Operator Precedence

```

## Unary Operators

By definition, a _unary_ operator is one that requires exactly one operand, or variable, to function.

```
| Operator           | Examples  | Description                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logical complement | !a        | Inverts a boolean's logical value                                                                                                   |
| Bitwise complement | ~b        | Inverts all 0s and 1s in a number                                                                                                   |
| Plus               | +c        | Indicates a number is positive, although numbers are assumed to be positive in Java unless accompanied by a negative unary operator |
| Negation or minus  | -d        | Indicates a literal number is negative or negates an expression                                                                     |
| Increment          | ++ef++    | Increments a value by 1                                                                                                             |
| Decrement          | --fh--    | Decrements a value by 1                                                                                                             |
| Cast               | (String)i | Casts a value to a specific type                                                                                                    |

```

### Increment and Decrement Operators

```
| Operator       | Example | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-increment  | ++w     | Increases the value by 1 and returns the new value      |
| Pre-decrement  | --x     | Decreases the value by 1 and returns the new value      |
| Post-increment | y++     | Increases the value by 1 and returns the original value |
| Post-decrement | z--     | Decreases the value by 1 and returns the original value |

```

## Binary Arithmetic Operators

- _Binary operators_ take two operands.
- They can be used to perform mathematical operations on variables, create logical expressions, and perform basic variable assignments.
- Binary operators are often combined in complex expressions with other binary operators; therefore, operator precedence is very important in evaluating expressions containing binary operators.

```
| Operator       | Example | Description                                                          |
|----------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Addition       | a + b   | Adds two numeric values                                              |
| Subtraction    | c - d   | Subtracts two numeric values                                         |
| Multiplication | e * f   | Multiplies two numeric values                                        |
| Division       | g / h   | Divides one numeric value by another                                 |
| Modulus        | i % j   | Returns the remainder after division of one numeric value by another |
```

### Order of Evaluation

From the Order of Operator Precedence section you know that the _multiplicative_ operators (`*`, `/`, `%`) have a higher order of precedence than the _additive_ operators (`+`, `-`).

```java
int price = 2 * 5 + 3 * 4 - 8;

// First, you evaluate the `2 * 5` and `3 * 4`, which reduces the expression to this:

int price = 10 + 12 - 8; // price = 14
```

### Adding Parentheses

You can change the order of operation explicitly by wrapping parentheses around the sections you want evaluated first.

```java
int price = 2 * ((5 + 3) * 4 - 8);
// This time you would evaluate the addition operator `5 + 3`, which reduces the expression to the following:
int price = 2 * (8 * 4 - 8);
// You can further reduce this expression by multiplying the first two values within the parentheses:
int price = 2 * (32 - 8);
// Next, you subtract the values within the parentheses before applying terms outside the parentheses:
int price = 2 * 24; // price = 48
```

### Division and Modulus Operators

```java
System.out.println(9 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(9 % 3); // 0

System.out.println(10 / 3); // 3
System.out.println(10 % 3); // 1
```

### Numeric Promotion

**Numeric Promotion Rules**

1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types.
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integral value to the floating-point value's data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely, `byte`, `short`, and `char`, are first promoted to `int` any time they're used with a Java binary arithmetic operator with a variable (as opposed to a value), even if neither of the operands is `int`.
4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.

### Casting Values

- _Casting_ is a unary operation where one data type is explicitly interpreted as another data type.
- Casting is optional and unnecessary when converting to a larger or widening data type, but it is required when converting to a smaller or narrowing data type.
- Without casting, the compiler will generate an error when trying to put a larger data type inside a smaller one.

Casting is performed by placing the data type, enclosed in parentheses, to the left of the value you want to cast.

```java
int fur = (int)5;
int hair = (short) 2;
String type = (String) "Bird";
short tail = (short)(4 + 10);
long feathers = 10(long); // DOES NOT COMPILE because the type is on the wrong side of the value.
```

You can NOT put a larger value into a smaller data type.

```java
// All of these examples involve putting a larger value into a smaller data type.
float egg = 2.0 / 9; // DOES NOT COMPILE
int tadpole = (int)5 * 2L; // DOES NOT COMPILE
short frog = 3 - 2.0; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

### Compound Assignment Operators

```
| Operator                  | Example  | Description                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Addition assignment       | a += 5   | Adds the value on the right to the variable on the left and assigns the sum to the variable               |
| Subtraction assignment    | b -= 0.2 | Subtracts the value on the right from the variable on the left and assigns the difference to the variable |
| Multiplication assignment | c *= 100 | Multiplies the value on the right with the variable on the left and assigns the product to the variable   |
| Division assignment       | d /= 4   | Divides the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the quotient to the variable       |

```

> Compound operators are useful for more than just shorthand—they can also save you from having to explicitly cast a value.

```
long goat = 10;
int sheep = 5;
sheep = sheep * goat; // DOES NOT COMPILE

sheep *= goat; // Will compile normally as it will first cast `sheep` to a `long`, apply the multiplication of two `long` values, and then cast the result to an `int`.
```
