# 06 Java — from Zero to Hero in 15 Days — Day 2 - part 2 - Comparing Values & Ternary Operator

## Comparing Values

### Equality Operators

```
| Operator   | Example   | Apply to primitives                                       | Apply to objects                                                |
|------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equality   | a == 10   | Returns true if the two values represent the same value   | Returns true if the two values reference the same object        |
| Inequality | b != 3.14 | Returns true if the two values represent different values | Returns true if the two values do not reference the same object |

```

### Relational Operators

```
| Operator                 | Example             | Description                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Less than                | a &lt; 5            | Returns true if the value on the left is strictly less than the value on the right                                                       |
| Less than or equal to    | b &lt;= 6           | Returns true if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right                                                    |
| Greater than             | c &gt; 9            | Returns true if the value on the left is strictly greater than the value on the right                                                    |
| Greater than or equal to | 3 &gt;= d           | Returns true if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right                                                 |
| Type comparison          | e instanceof String | Returns true if the reference on the left side is an instance of the type on the right side (class, interface, record, enum, annotation) |

```

### _instanceof_ Operator

It is useful for determining whether an arbitrary object is a member of a particular class or interface at runtime.

```java
public void openZoo(Number time) {
	if (time instanceof Integer) {
		System.out.print((Integer)time + " O'clock");
	} else {
		System.out.print(time);
	}
}
```

### Logical Operators

- The logical operators, (`&`), (`|`), and (`^`), may be applied to both numeric and `boolean` data types.
- When they're applied to `boolean` data types, they're referred to as _logical operators_.
- Alternatively, when they're applied to numeric data types, they're referred to as _bitwise operators_, as they perform bitwise comparisons of the bits that compose the number.
- AND is only `true` if both operands are `true`.
- Inclusive OR is only `false` if both operands are `false`.
- Exclusive OR is only `true` if the operands are different.

```
| Operator             | Example   | Description                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logical AND          | a & b     | Value is true only if both values are true.                     |
| Logical inclusive OR | c | d     | Value is true if at least one of the values is true.            |
| Logical exclusive OR | e ^ f     | Value is true only if one value is true and the other is false. |

```

```java

// Java program to illustrate
// bitwise operators

public class operators {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Initial values
		int a = 5;
		int b = 7;

		// bitwise and
		// 0101 & 0111=0101 = 5
		System.out.println("a&b = " + (a & b));

		// bitwise or
		// 0101 | 0111=0111 = 7
		System.out.println("a|b = " + (a | b));

		// bitwise xor
		// 0101 ^ 0111=0010 = 2
		System.out.println("a^b = " + (a ^ b));

		// bitwise not
		// ~00000000 00000000 00000000 00000101=11111111 11111111 11111111 11111010
		// will give 2's complement (32 bit) of 5 = -6
		System.out.println("~a = " + ~a);

		// can also be combined with
		// assignment operator to provide shorthand
		// assignment
		// a=a&b
		a &= b;
		System.out.println("a= " + a);
	}
}

```

### Conditional Operators

```
| Operator        | Example        | Description                                                                                                               |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Conditional AND | a &amp;&amp; b | Value is true only if both values are true. If the left side is false, then the right side will not be evaluated.         |
| Conditional OR  | c || d         | Value is true if at least one of the values is true. If the left side is true, then the right side will not be evaluated. |

```

The _conditional operators_, often called short-circuit operators, are nearly identical to the logical operators, `&` and `|`, except that the right side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result can be determined by the left side of the expression.

#### Avoiding a _NullPointerException_

A more common example of where conditional operators are used is checking for `null` objects before performing an operation. In the following example, if `duck` is `null`, the program will throw a `NullPointerException` at runtime:

```java
// Could throw a NullPointerException as it will always evaluates both sides of the expression
if(duck!=null & duck.getAge()<5) {
	// Do something
}

// In this example, if `duck` is `null`, the conditional prevents a `NullPointerException` from ever being thrown,
// since the evaluation of `duck.getAge() < 5` is never reached.
if(duck!=null && duck.getAge()<5) {
	// Do something
}
```

## Making Decisions with the Ternary Operator

It takes this format

```java

// booleanExpression ? expression1 : expression2

int owl = 5;
int food = owl < 2 ? 3 : 4;

System.out.println(food); // 4
```
