# 02 Java — from Zero to Hero in 15 Days — Day 1 - part 2 - Compiling Your Application

## Compiling with Jar Files

You can also specify the location of the other files explicitly using a classpath. This technique is useful when the class files are located elsewhere or in special JAR files.

    # On Windows, you type the following:
    java -cp ".;C:\temp\someOtherLocation;c:\temp\myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass

    # And on macOS/Linux, you type this:
    java -cp ".:/tmp/someOtherLocation:/tmp/myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass

The period (.) indicates that you want to include the current directory in the classpath. Just like when you're compiling, you can use a wildcard (*) to match all the JARs in a directory.

## Creating a Jar File

A *Java archive* (JAR) file is like a ZIP file of mainly Java class files. You can create a Jar file using the jar command

    # You can use the short or long form for each option.
    jar -cvf myNewFile.jar .
    jar --create --verbose --file myNewFile.jar .

    # Alternatively, you can specify a directory
    # instead of using the current directory.
    jar -cvf myNewFile.jar -C dir .
