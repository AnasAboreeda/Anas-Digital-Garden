# Queue

## Implementation with Double Linked List

- Enqueue: use `List.PushBack`
- Dequeue: use `List.TopFront` and `List.PopFront`
- Empty: use `List.Empty`

---

- Queues can be implemented with either a linked list (with tail pointer) or an array.
- Each queue operation is O(1): Enqueue, Dequeue, Empty.

## Todo

- Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
  - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
  - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
  - empty()
- Implement using fixed-sized array:
  - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
  - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
  - empty()
  - full()

### Cost

- a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)  
  because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
- enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
- dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
- empty: O(1) (linked list and array)
