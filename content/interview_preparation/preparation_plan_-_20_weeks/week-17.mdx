### Pre-reading (due Wed, Mar 3)

- Read the [“Fear” chapter](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F2B_Uw8vOaxAiI8QP6tM3V5-VmXNhOOo?usp=sharing) from *Playing Big: Practical Wisdom for Women Who Want to Speak Up, Create, and Lead* by Tara Mohr
    - Note: I'm skipping the first few pages of the chapter. She describes there 2 types of fear.
        - Pachad = overreactive, irrational fear that stems from worries about what could happen
        - Yirah = the feeling that overcomes us when we inhabit a larger space than we used to (like when you get promoted at work and are scared about whether you can do your job)
