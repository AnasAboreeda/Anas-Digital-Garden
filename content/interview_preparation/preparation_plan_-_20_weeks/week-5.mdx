## WEEK #5 SOFT SKILLS: Behavioral interviews continued

### Assigned reading & videos (due Mon, Dec 7 EOD)

- None :) Catch up on the old reading if you missed anything

### Homework (due Mon, Dec 7 EOD)

- In your “Behavioral Interviews Answers” document, answer the following questions.
    - Questions to answer:
        - What's an example of a time you faced a challenge?
        - What's an example of a time you faced a conflict?
        - What's an example of a time you failed or made a mistake or got negative feedback?
    - Instructions:
        - Label each one using this format: “Question name - ORIGINAL”
        - Force yourself to use a different story to answer each question. Don't re-use stories you already used answering the question “What's an example of a project you're proud of?”
- Meet with your assigned partner to improve your answers to all 3 questions
    - The list of partners is below on the next page
    - First, ask your partner to write their name and feedback in your document below each question. Iliana will be reviewing this later to see how professional the feedback is. :)
        - Remember that feedback should be specific and phrased in a positive way
        - When giving feedback, think about:
            - What are they doing well? What can they do better?
            - STARR format
            - Why? How?
            - Business / project context & impact
            - Telling an engaging, clear story
            - Taking (enough) credit
    - Next, write a second draft of your answers and label it “Question name - REVISED WITH PARTNER”
- Practice speaking your answers aloud
    - Practice all of your questions (including “What's an example of a project you're proud of?”)
    - Make sure it sounds natural, not memorized (even though you've been practicing)
    - Be prepared to share your answer in front of the group on Wednesday!

Iliana will send separate instructions on this. The deadline is December 20.
