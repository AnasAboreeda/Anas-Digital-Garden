## WEEK #16: SOFT SKILLS: Amazon

### Pre-reading (due Tue, Feb 23)

- Amazon has very high expectations for behavioral interviews. Most of their approach is similar to what you have learned so far, but the expectations are higher. In addition, they may ask you questions about “Amazon leadership principles.” Prepare by reading/watching these materials:
    - [Amazon: Our Leadership Principles](https://www.aboutamazon.eu/working-at-amazon/our-leadership-principles)
    - [Dan Croiter on YouTube: “Best Answer: What's your favorite Amazon leadership principle?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnYa51tNEE)”
    - [Interview Genie: How to answer questions about Amazon leadership principle “Customer Obsession”](https://interviewgenie.com/blog-1/2017/11/28/how-to-answer-amazon-leadership-principle-customer-obsession-interview-questions)
    - [Dave Anderson (Medium): Interviewing at Amazon: Leadership Principles](https://medium.com/@scarletinked/are-you-the-leader-were-looking-for-interviewing-at-amazon-8301d787815d)

### Homework (due Tue, Feb 23)

- Choose one of the questions from the “Interview Genie” article and answer it in your behavioral interview questions & answers document.
