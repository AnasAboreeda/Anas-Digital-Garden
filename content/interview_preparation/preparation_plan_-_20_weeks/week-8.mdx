# Week 8

## WEEK #8 SOFT SKILLS: Behavioral interviews continued

### Assigned reading & videos (due Mon, Dec 28 EOD)

- None :)
- OPTIONAL: Read the book *How to Win Friends and Influence People* by Dave Carnegie (or find related content online) [this is highly recommended by our mentor Walla Oriqat]

### Homework (due Mon, Dec 28 EOD)

- Read the mock interview feedback other Manara candidates have received
    - The goal of reading other people's mock interview feedback is to accelerate your learning. If you see what they did well & wrong, it will help you do those things better!
    - Read at least 2 behavioral and 2 technical mock interview results
    - You can find examples here:
        - Good examples from Cohorts 3+4 in [column H](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pDdQPG5DyFFLgDmAPd3thSXFHPxWWPiDiSliavuvAmA/edit?usp=sharing)
        - Cohort 5 [folders](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1CxoBp77WYef3iK5AzbpDx6Z3YCQEYm8F)
- If you haven't finished this already:
    - Ask your mentor to review & help you improve your answers to typical behavioral interview questions (note: your mentor might not meet with you during the holiday break; it's optional)

## WEEK #8 TECHNICAL: Recursion + Pre-reading for Trees

### Pre-reading on Trees (due Sat, Jan 2 EOD)

- Textbook: Read Chapter 4 in the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7ERENZtSqGiTGRMMm1zWFduS0E) book (Page 112 of PDF)
- Online materials:
    - Watch: [Data Structures: Trees from HackerRank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSWTXtMglKE)
    - Watch: [Data Structures: Heap from HackerRank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA)
    - Read: [Everything you need to know about tree structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-tree-data-structures-bceacb85490c/)
- OPTIONAL
    - Slides & recordings from Cohort #3: all videos are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MOesN_rOwKIBmPzX_IaP-rCaJxPDysq7), please watch the ones on this week's topic
    - Slides & recordings from Cohort #2: all are [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P3Qbz7sWk3vj1KgvaKmwrs_vbMSgnEtw), please read/watch the ones on this week's topic

### Homework on Recursion (due Sat, Jan 2 EOD)

- Solve 10 easy/medium leetcode questions [here](https://leetcode.com/tag/recursion/). Use recursion to solve them. *[Total Leetcode questions due by now = 70]* Here are some recommended ones:
    1. [https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/)
    2. [https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
    3. [https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/)
    4. [https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/)
    5. [https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value/)
- Solve 2 recursion questions on Hackerrank (see [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=recursion) and [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit/recursion-backtracking/challenges) using recursion. Post the questions & your answers on cohort5-collaboration for feedback from your peers & TAs. (Don't look at other people's answers until you've tried your own!)
- No Code Signal homework this week
