# Week 6

## WEEK #6 SOFT SKILLS: catch up & mock interview

### Assigned reading & videos (due Mon, Dec 14 EOD)

- None, catch up on previous weeks! :)

### Homework (due Mon, Dec 14 EOD)

- In your behavioral interview questions document, answer this question:
    - “Tell me about yourself”
- Clean up your “behavioral interview questions” document
    - You're going to share this document with your mentor, and continue using it as a reference when you practice interviewing, so it's time to clean it up!
    - Keep just your best answer for each question
    - Delete:
        - all the old answers (labeled “ORIGINAL”)
        - feedback or comments you received
        - other comments (e.g., indicating which part is the situation, task, action, result, repeat)
- Improve your answers
    - With your mentor, if you have time (in addition to or instead of your mock interview), review all your behavioral interview questions so far and improve them even more.
- Mentorship meeting notes
    - Create a document in your folder called “Mentorship notes: Mentee First name last name <> Mentor First name last name” (example: “Mentorship notes: Maha Hajja <> Jennifer Wang”)
    - Make sure either you or your mentor takes notes on every meeting in that document. **We recommend your mentor take notes during the first 3 meetings, and after that you start taking notes.** You will learn a lot by seeing how your mentor takes notes.
    - By December 14 you should have had 1-2 mentorship meetings already. You should be meeting your mentor 1/week.
- You will do a soft skills mock interview this week. Iliana will send separate instructions on this. The deadline is December 20.
