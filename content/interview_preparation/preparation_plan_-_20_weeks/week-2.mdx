## WEEK #2 SOFT SKILLS: Intro to behavioral interviews

### Assigned reading & videos (due Tue, Nov 17 EOD)

- Read [the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rCIladYt33WmkTU4GGPf4gZONTJLTFW0FncFmnbjTDI/edit?usp=sharing) we were supposed to have on Nov 11. We'll go through it quickly this week so we don't fall behind.

### Homework (due Tue, Nov 17 EOD)

- In your homework folder
    - Edit the name of the file from last week so it is called “Soft skills homework #1 - First name last name”
    - Add a new file for this week called “Soft skills homework #2 - First name last name.” Do the homework this week in that file.
- Think about a situation you faced recently that bothered you - at work, school, home, etc. Gather your thoughts, then write down how you would share that feedback to that person. Remember to consider:
1. Data / what you observed
2. Your feelings, your assumptions, and/or the impact it had
3. Your request

## WEEK #2 TECHNICAL: Clean Code + pre-reading for Big O

### Assigned reading & videos (due Sat, Nov 21 EOD)

- Read the book *Clean Code* by Robert Martin (or at least some of it)
    - Ideally, purchase it if you can. If not, you can find it online (e.g., [here](https://enos.itcollege.ee/~jpoial/oop/naited/Clean%20Code.pdf)) or read [this summary article.](https://medium.com/better-programming/clean-code-5-essential-takeaways-2a0b17ccd05c)
- Pre-reading for Big O next week
    - Textbook: Read the Big-O chapter in the [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7ERENZtSqGiTGRMMm1zWFduS0E) book (page 50 of PDF).
    - Online videos:
        - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duvZ-2UK0fc)

### Homework (due Sat, Nov 21 EOD)

- Solve 10 easy Leetcode questions. Choose any questions you want. Focus on writing clean, maintainable code. *[Total Leetcode questions due by now = 20]*
- Pick a leetcode easy problem and solve it, but do not include the exact text of the problem in your solution. Swap solutions with the buddy listed below. Without looking at the list of problems on leetcode, try and write a summary of the problem that your buddy was trying to solve.
- In the cohort5-collaboration channel, share:
    1. An important takeaway you learned from the book *Clean Code* or from the exercise you did with a buddy
    2. A question you have about Big O / Runtime Complexity
