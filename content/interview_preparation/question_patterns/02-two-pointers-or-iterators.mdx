# 02 Two Pointers or Iterators

# 02 Two Pointers or Iterators

- Two Pointers is a pattern where two pointers iterate through the data structure in tandem until one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition.
- Two Pointers is often useful when searching pairs in a sorted array or linked list; for example, when you have to compare each element of an array to its other elements.
- Two pointers are needed because with just pointer, you would have to continually loop back through the array to find the answer.
- This back and forth with a single iterator is inefficient for time and space complexity—a concept referred to as asymptotic analysis.
- While the brute force or naive solution with 1 pointer would work, it will produce something along the lines of O(n²).
- In many cases, two pointers can help you find a solution with better space or runtime complexity

## Ways to Identify When to Use the Two Pointer Method:

- It will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or Linked Lists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfil certain constraints
- The set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even a subarray

## Here Are Some Problems That Feature the Two Pointer Pattern:

- Squaring a sorted array (easy)
- Triplets that sum to zero (medium)
- Comparing strings that contain backspaces (medium)
