# Step by step Guide for Tech Interviews

The absolute best candidates lead interviews. They require very little guidance from the interviewer. They're the ones who drive the conversation, not the interviewer.

These candidates will usually go through these steps by themselves with little to no prompting from the interviewer:

1. Ask clarifying questions.
2. Analyze various solutions and tradeoffs.
3. Plan solution with pseudocode.
4. Implement solution.
5. Test.

ðŸš« Starting to write code within the first five minutes of an interview can often be a very bad sign.

## Ask Great Clarifying Questions

Here are some great clarifying questions to ask:

- Should this be done be in place? (No additional memory)
- Can we make any assumptions about the input?
- Do we care more about performance or saving memory?

## Don't Make Assumptions

Too often, candidates make assumptions about the problem (i.e., all integers are positive, arrays are not empty, all input is safe) â€¦ **big** red flag.

Never assume that the conditions of the problem are aligned as is convenient for you to solve the problem. Instead, just **ask**.

## Talk about Tradeoffs

We interviewers love to see when candidates discuss various approaches to a problem.  
It shows that you understand that there are always multiple approaches to a problem but, more importantly, pressures the interviewer into **giving you a hint** without you explicitly asking for it. Booyah!

## Plan Your Solution with Pseudocode

It could be pseudocode, or it could be a simple drawing, but make sure you know what data structures you'll be using and what variables you'll need to keep track of.

## Implement Your Solution

### Talk out Loud

## Testing

For some reason, this is the most overlooked step. I'd say 98% of the candidates that I interviewed could have benefited from better testing.

> We give you the simplest possible test case. Likely a test case with **no edge cases** **nor** with the capability to properly test your code.
>

**The easiest way to stand out in a coding interview is to** â€¦ write more tests. Write harder tests. Write comprehensive tests.
