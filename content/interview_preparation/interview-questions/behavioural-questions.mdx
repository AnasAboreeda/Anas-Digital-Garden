# Behavioural Questions

## Unusual Behavioural Questions

- **Do you have a screen protector on your phone? Why?**
- **How do you criticize people?**
    - Once they break down their process, I follow up with:
        - *Criticize me.*
- **Teach me something fascinating that I don't know yet.**
- **You enter an elevator with your dream client who asks you what you do for a living. How do you respond?**
- **What steps would you implement to maintain trust among coworkers in a remote work setting?** This question tests your creative problem-solving skills on the spot.
    - The two things I'm waiting to tick off in my mind are:
        - Is it scalable?
        - Is it personal?
    - I would often follow up with:
        - *And if you had to scale that to 3,000 employees, how would you go about it?*
- **What do you want to have written on your gravestone one day and how is this position going to help you achieve that?**

| Competency | Changelog (Jun 29) | Description | Sample Questions | 1 - Strong No | 2No | 3 - Mixed | 4 - Yes | 5 - Strong Yes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall |  |  |  | Not yet ready to job hunt, needs a lot more help to prepare OR English was poor OR internet connection was too poor to assess | Decent performance for someone from an emerging market country. Answered questions and showed some potential (e.g., used STARR method) but not impressive | Strong performance for someone from an emerging market country. Very strong chance of getting hired at a company that adjusts its behavioral expectations to international candidates (e.g., Upwork). Not clear if they can compete with top candidates from Europe/USA. | Could definitely compete with top candidates from Europe/USA for companies that don't have a crazy high bar for soft skills (e.g., Google) | Could easily compete with top 10% of Stanford students! Strong chance of getting hired by a company with very high behavioral standards (e.g., Amazon, Stripe, Facebook) |
| Environment |  | The candidate's interview set up is professional and enables an effective interview that makes a positive impression. They have excellent internet, good lighting, a pleasant background. NOTE: If the candidate's electricity has been turned off (e.g., in Gaza) please make an exception for lighting as long as the candidate does a good job explaining the situation and the internet is still strong enough for the interview. | none | Internet did not work well enough to interview or other severe issues (was wearing something very inappropriate, etc). Or candidate showed up > 5 minutes late. | Internet had connectivity issues that lasted > 2 minutes or the environment was otherwise poor (e.g., couldn't turn camera on, lighting made a negative impression), etc | Candidate's environment was fine but not particularly appealing (e.g., clutter in the background or unattractive wall & lighting) | Candidate's internet worked well, lighting was fine, clothing fine, background fine. | Candidate's internet, lighting, clothing, background were all stellar - these made a positive impression in and of themselves and made you think "wow I should consider doing that" |
| English |  | The candidate knows English well enough to be able to work effectively. Or better yet, their English is almost at native speaker level - so strong that it would not be a barrier to any job. | none, all interview questions apply | I was not able to understand the candidate and the candidate was not able to understand me. | There were enough challenges in understanding each other that I was not able to assess the candidate's other soft skills. | There were several moments in the interview when the candidate struggled to understand me or vice-versa, but we were still able to have a productive interview. If they worked at a US company, they would likely struggle with English at first but become more fluent over time. | The candidate was able to express effectively. They may hve had some hesitations/mistakes/challenges finding the right vocabulary or a bit of an accent, but any native English speaker making a small effort can easily work with them. The candidate understood almost everything I said. | The candidate is almost at native speaker English level. |
| Communication |  | Communication is very broad, and can cover presentation skills, verbal communication, an ability to explain new concepts clearly, written communication, slide decks, data visualisations, gesticulations with hands, listening, asking clarifying questions, and expectation-setting. Communication styles vary widely among candidates; you should focus on whether they are able to get their point across, and able to accurately interpret your questions.Some people are naturally less communicative than others when speaking to strangers, and especially in interviews. You should assess them on the entirety of their communicative ability, not just their ability to talk fast and off the cuff. It's fine to coax more out of a person, and/or give them time to warm up. Whenever possible, ask open questions to give the candidate the opportunity to talk. | none, all interview questions apply | The candidate does not ask any questions, and doesn't listen. They solve the wrong problem as a result.The candidate is incapable of describing a concept or topic even when they are intimately familiar with it (unless — in truly exceptional cases — the topic is so complicated that the interviewer lacks the context necessary to understand it).The candidate cannot clearly communicate their intentions or thought process, even after significant encouragement and prodding.The candidate does not engage in nonverbal communication: e.g., hand gestures, eye contact, facial expressions | The candidate's intent is frequently unclear. The candidate needs a frequent re-framing of a problem to understand it.The cannot adequately explain why they chose the approach they took.The candidate does not engage in nonverbal communication: e.g., hand gestures, eye contact, facial expressions | The candidate needs to say things multiple times to get their point across to a good faith listener.The candidate can communicate an idea at a high level, but lacks precision and nuance in the details.The candidate “handwaves” complex parts of code despite being prodded to expound.They are unable to describe a time where they convinced someone of something, or used language to influence something.The candidate engages in some nonverbal communication (eye contact, facial expressions, hand gestures) but not enough to feel connected. | When solving a problem, the candidate asks questions to clarify needs, and is able to describe an approach at a high-level. They describe how their code works, unprompted. They are able to communicate complex topics to a layperson.The candidate clearly imparts knowledge and concepts through appropriate means, including, but not limited to, diagrams, body movement, writing and speech. When explaining something, the candidate talks at a level appropriate to their audience.The candidate describes a time where their communication influenced a decision.The candidate engages in nonverbal communication (eye contact, facial expressions, hand gestures) which leads to a feeling of connection and enthusiasm | The candidate frequently checks understanding when explaining a complex concept, and if there is any misunderstanding, is able to unpack the problem and effectively communicate the necessary information. The candidate finds the precise word they want to convey the exact meaning they need (even if they takes a few seconds to do so).They are able to explain with great precision why they took the steps they did on a project. The candidate has put together cases that persuade a skeptical audience.The candidate engages in excellent nonverbal communication (eye contact, facial expressions, hand gestures) which leads to a feeling of connection and enthusiasm |
| Teamwork | - Renamed Collaboration to TeamworkRemoved Toughest decision question | If a candidate has worked exclusively in very small teams, much of this might be theoretical. In technical interviews, judge the candidate on their ability to use you for your knowledge, and willingness to ask for help. Pay attention to how they describe their role on previous teams, and whether they are comfortable sharing credit and accepting blame. | * Tell me about a time you knew you were right, but still had to follow directions or guidelines.* What's an example of a time when you faced conflict with a team? * How would your colleagues describe you? | The candidate describes themselves as a loner, doing their best work alone.Demonstrates no understanding of the value of working within teams and cannot describe a time where working with others was beneficial.The candidate is suspicious, generally, of “teamwork” as a concept.The candidate describes people with whom they disagree as, for example, “stupid” | The candidate describes successes as “I”, but describes failures as “we”.The candidate does not like working with others.They do not make use of the interviewer when they are stuck and trying to solve a The candidate fails to solicit input from teammates.The candidate describes situations in terms like “us vs them”, dismissing those with whom there are disagreements as “other”. | The candidate describes working with others, albeit with some reluctance.They demonstrate a limited capability to work on a problem with others.They ask some questions, though conversation on a problem falls short of a meaningful dialog. | The candidate is happy working with others to achieve an outcome.The candidate employs a collaborative approach to problem solving, soliciting feedback, and integrating it into their solution.The candidate brings others with them.The candidate does not merely hand out tasks, and is not satisfied with merely receiving tasks to complete. | The candidate demonstrates repeated examples of working with others to achieve a desired outcome.They are eager to work with others.The candidate describes times where other people provided skills that they were lacking.Describes achievements as “we” as appropriate (though taking individual credit for their specific contribution is fine). |
| Curiosity | - Added product improvement aspect | The candidate's curiosity drives them to learn more. They're excited by the possibility of growing, and by the possibility of improving the product for its users & business potential or technological potential.Curiosity does not have to be codeor industry-related. A demonstrated curiosity about, for example (and without limitation), their family genealogy, a foreign culture, cuisine, the mechanics of windmills, literary history, biomechanics etc. are all interesting. | * Why do you want to work at $COMPANY?* How do you keep up to date with tech?* Do you have any side projects or contributions to open source?* What are some ideas you have to improve our product? | The candidate demonstrates no interest in $COMPANY, or in the world around them, and provides no evidence that they want to learn more. | The candidate isn't able to describe any self-directed learning or meaningful areas of our product/company that they are curious about.They accept every statement at face value, without digging in. They ask no questions. | The candidate asked, “why?” once or twice, but isn't particularly interested in the impact the answers have in the product and for the customer. They don't go deeper. The candidate's ideas for our product are basic.The questions the candidate asks are fairly standard, on topics like tech stack, or working hours, without really seeking any deep insight. The product ideas that the candidate has are equally standard/uninspiring/lack depth.The candidate has done a little self-directed learning on a topic that interests them. | The candidate asks insightful questions about $COMPANY.They ask follow-up questions to go deeper on topics. Their questions uncover the impact to the product, the customer, or the candidate's curiosity.They describe times when they have done independent research, on any topic.They have interesting ideas for our product or questions about our users.The candidate describes needing to figure out why something was broken, and derives satisfaction from finding answers. | The candidate displays an insatiable appetite for learning, provides ample evidence of self-improvement and asking questions, and gets excited when they recognise an opportunity for improving the product, impacting customers, and learning.The candidate runs out of time asking questions, and still has more to ask.The candidate's ideas for our product are excellent, or the thought process she engages in indicates the ability to come up with great ideas for improvements |
| Growth Mindset | - Renamed to Growth Mindset (self-awareness is still a big deal here, chosing this name with the assumption that to effectively benefit from a growth mindset you are required to be self-aware. plus being self-aware without a growth mindset means you just suffer) <-- LOL | We want candidates who know themselves, who will respond well to feedback, and who are self-aware enough to know what their deficiencies are and seek to work with those who can support them.It will typically be hard to make a call on this in a purely technical interview. However, it is instructive to see how the candidate responds when bugs with their code are pointed out. An inability to recognise or accept a mistake can be problematic. Contrariwise, responding well to a bug with humour and good grace is a good sign. | * Tell me about a major mistake you made, and what you did to correct it.* What's an example of negative or constructive feedback you've received and how you handled it?* What's an example of a time when you faced a challenge? Or a failure? | The candidate demonstrates a significant lack of self-awareness and of introspection.The candidate fails to meaningfully identify any ways in which they could improve.The candidate uncritically gives themselves a 10/10 for performance at all their past positions.The candidate demonstrates no interest in receiving feedback. | When asked to identify opportunities for improvement, the candidate gives false-modest answers like “sometimes I work too hard.”They can't identify their performance at a previous position relative to their peers.They don't know how their manager would rate them, or why.They have rejected concrete feedback in the past, and were unable to see why it was offered. | The candidate recognises that they can improve, but speaks in vague terms that demonstrate a lack of significant thought on the matter.The candidate is ambivalent about receiving feedback.The candidate is unable to articulate a time when receiving feedback, or self-analysis, helped them become better. | The candidate describes a time when they received critical feedback, and were able to integrate it to become better.They make reflective statements like “I was immature”, or “I wasn't willing to compromise”, or “I've learned that getting buy-in from others is important”.The candidate knows themselves, and has thought about how they can improve.The candidate made deliberate career choices in response to past experiences. | The candidate is able to critique their own past performance and identify a number of growth opportunities.They compare their past selves with their current selves unflinchingly, and identify areas where they have improved and the steps they took.The candidate is aware that they make mistakes and demonstrates a desire to learn from them.The candidate speaks objectively about their own shortcomings and describes strategies for mitigating them.They are eager to receive feedback, and demand it. |
| Leadership | - Added as Leadership/OwnershipRenamed to LeadershipAdded Toughest decision question | We want candidates who will be the leaders of their companies in the future. They do not have to have existing leadership experience, but they do display the traits of a leader: taking ownership and responsibility, being able to influence others, making strategic decisions. | * Tell me about the toughest decision you've had to make in the past six months.* Tell me about a time you needed to motivate a co-worker.* What's an example of a project in which you played a leadership role?* What do you think makes a good leader? | The candidate displays no signs of leadership potential or interest. The candidate waits for instructions, does not do anything unless asked, shirks responsibility, does not engage with a team to improve it. | The candidate was not able to share examples of leadership | The candidate had at least one story to share in the interview in which they displayed the traits of a leader | The candidate may not have had official leadership experience but provides great examples in which they behaved like a leader | The candidate has great examples of leadership experience - in charge of a team or project, influenced it successfully, managed difficult dynamics effectively |
