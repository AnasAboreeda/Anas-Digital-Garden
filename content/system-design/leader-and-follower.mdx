# Leader and Follower

## Background

- Distributed systems keep multiple copies of data for fault tolerance and higher availability.
- A system can use quorum to ensure data consistency between replicas, i.e., all reads and writes are not considered successful until a majority of nodes participate in the operation.
- However, using ***quorum** can lead to another problem*, that is, **lower availability**; at any time, the system needs to ensure that at least a majority of replicas are up and available, otherwise the operation will fail.
- Quorum is also not sufficient, as in certain failure scenarios, the client can still see inconsistent data.

## Solution

<aside>
⚖️ Allow only a single server (called leader) to be responsible for data replication and to coordinate work.

</aside>

- At any time, one server is elected as the leader.
- This leader becomes responsible for data replication and can act as the central point for all coordination.
- The followers only accept writes from the leader and serve as a backup.
- In case the leader fails, one of the followers can become the leader.
- In some cases, the follower can serve read requests for load balancing.
