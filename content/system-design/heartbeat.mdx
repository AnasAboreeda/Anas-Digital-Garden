# Heartbeat

## Background

- In a distributed environment, work/data is distributed among servers.
- To efficiently route requests in such a setup, servers need to know what other servers are part of the system.
- Furthermore, servers should know if other servers are alive and working.
- In a decentralized system, whenever a request arrives at a server, the server should have enough information to decide which server is responsible for entertaining that request.
- This makes the timely detection of server failure an important task, which also enables the system to take corrective actions and move the data/work to another healthy server and stop the environment from further deterioration.

## Solution

- Each *server periodically sends a heartbeat message to a central monitoring server* or other servers in the system to show that it is still alive and functioning.
- Heartbeating is one of the mechanisms for detecting failures in a distributed system.
- If there is a central server, all servers periodically send a heartbeat message to it.
- If there is no central server, all servers randomly choose a set of servers and send them a heartbeat message every few seconds.
- This way, if no heartbeat message is received from a server for a while, the system can suspect that the server might have crashed.
- If there is no heartbeat within a configured timeout period, the system can conclude that the server is not alive anymore and stop sending requests to it and start working on its replacement.
