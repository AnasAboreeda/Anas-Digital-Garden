# Redundancy, Replication and Fault Tolerance

## Redundancy

- [Redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)) is the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of increasing the reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to improve actual system performance.
- For example, if there is only one copy of a file stored on a single server, then losing that server means losing the file.
- Since losing data is seldom a good thing, we can create duplicate or redundant copies of the file to solve this problem.
- Redundancy plays a key role in removing the single points of failure in the system and provides backups if needed in a crisis.
- For example, if we have two instances of a service running in production and one fails, the system can failover to the other one.

## Replication

- [Replication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_(computing)) means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources, such as software or hardware components, to improve reliability, [fault-tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance), or accessibility.
- Replication is widely used in many database management systems (DBMS), usually with a primary-replica relationship between the original and the copies.
- The primary server gets all the updates, which then ripple through to the replica servers.
- Each replica outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of subsequent updates.

## Fault Tolerance

- **Fault tolerance** is the property that enables a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System) to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of one or more faults within some of its components.
- If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown.
- Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in [high-availability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-availability) or [life-critical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-critical_system). The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as **graceful degradation**.
- A **fault-tolerant design** enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system [fails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure).
