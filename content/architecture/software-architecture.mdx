# Software Architecture

## Importance of Getting the Application Architecture Right

The key element in successfully creating anything is getting the base right. Now whether it is constructing a building or making a pizza. If we don't get the base right, we have to start over. Yeah!!.. I know, but there is no other way around.

Building a web application is no different. The architecture is it's base & has to be carefully thought, to avoid any major design changes & code refactoring at a later point in time.

## An Overview of the Software Development Process

1. First step is usually Requirement Gathering & Analysis : Architects, developers and product owners spend a lot of time studying & discussing business requirements.
2. Then we create a High-level Design Document: we sit down & brainstorm the use cases which we have to implement. This involves figuring out the corner cases as early as possible & fitting the Lego blocks together.
3. Then we start with Proof Of Concept: After we pick the fitting tech stack, we start writing a POC (Proof of Concept) to helps us get a closer, more hands-on view of the technology & the basic use case implementation. We get an insight into the pros and cons of the tech, performance or other technical limitations if any. Also, it helps with the learning curve if we're working with completely new tech, also the non-technical people like the product owners, stakeholders have something concrete to play with & to base their further decisions on.
4. Finally we build the First MVP version (Minimum viable product) and launch it to few specific segment of our users to get a feedback and discover more edge cases.

## Different Tiers in Software Architecture

### What is a Tier

Tier is a logical separation of components in an application or a service.Usually, it's a physical separation at the component level, not the code level.

### What is a Component

Usually these are the different components that make up a web service:

- Database
- Backend application server
- User interface
- Messaging
- Caching

There are multiple technologies involved in the HTTP Push based mechanism such as:

- Ajax Long polling
- Web Sockets
- HTML5 Event Source
- Message Queues
- Streaming over HTTP

Every tech has a specific use case,

Ajax is used to dynamically update the web page by polling the server at regular intervals.

Long polling has a connection open time slightly longer than the polling mechanism.

Web Sockets have bi-directional data flow, whereas Server sent events facilitate data flow from the server to the client.

Streaming over HTTP facilitates streaming of large objects like multi-media files.

## Horizontal Scaling

- It takes much less administrative, monitoring, management efforts as opposed to when managing a distributed environment.
- If you need to run the code in a distributed environment, it needs to be stateless
- This is why functional programming got so popular with distributed systems. The functions don't retain any state.
- The upsides of horizontally scaling include no limit to augmenting the hardware capacity. Data is replicated across different geographical regions as nodes & data centres are set up across the globe.

## Redundancy – Active-passive Ha Mode

Redundancy is duplicating the components or instances & keeping them on standby to take over in case the active instances go down. It's the fail-safe, backup mechanism.

## Replication – Active-active Ha Mode

Replication means having a number of similar nodes running the workload together. There are no standby or passive instances. When a single or a few nodes go down, the remaining nodes bear the load of the service.

## Micro Frontends Integration

There are two ways we can do this -

### By Integrating Micro Frontends on the Client

A recommended way to integrate components on the client-side is by leveraging a technology called the Web Components & frameworks such as [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/) (it's a JavaScript framework for frontend microservices that enables the developers to build their frontend leveraging different JavaScript frameworks.)

### By Integrating Micro Frontends on the Server

There are multiple options here:

1. [Project Mosaic](https://www.mosaic9.org/)
2. [Open Components](https://opencomponents.github.io/) is an open-source micro frontends framework used for integrating micro frontends on the server.
3. [Server Side Includes (SSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes) is a server-side scripting language used for clubbing the content of multiple web pages on the webserver.
4. [Podium](https://podium-lib.io/) is another framework that facilitates easy server-side composition of micro frontends.

# Databases

## Relational Database

- Normalized data means a unique entity occurs in only one place/table, in its simplest and atomic form and is not spread throughout the database. This helps in maintaining the consistency of the data. In future, if we want to update the data, we just update at that one place and every fetch operation gets the updated data.

### Acid Transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

Besides normalization & consistency, relational databases also ensure ACID transactions.

An acid transaction means if a transaction in a system occurs, say a financial transaction, either it will be executed with perfection without affecting any other processes or transactions or rolled back. The system will have a new state after the transaction which is durable & consistent. Or if anything, amiss happens during the transaction, say a minor system failure, the entire operation is rolled back.

## Disadvantages

- Well, one big limitation with SQL based relational databases is Scalability. Scaling relational databases is something which is not trivial. They have to be Sharded or Replicated to make them run smoothly on a cluster.

## Nosql Databases

They are easier to scale and cluster but NoSQL databases had to sacrifice Strong consistency, ACID Transactions & much more to scale horizontally over a cluster & across the data centres. The data with NoSQL databases is more Eventually Consistent as opposed to being Strongly Consistent.

Though the inconsistency does not mean that there is any sort of data loss. It just means that the data takes a short while to travel across the globe via the internet cables under the ocean to reach a global consensus and become consistent.

Note: A well-designed SQL data store will always be more performant than a not so well-designed NoSQL store.

# What is Cap Theorem?

CAP stands for Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

CAP theorem simply states that in case of a network failure, when a few of the nodes of the system are down, we have to make a choice between Availability & Consistency

In IT solution architecture, Microsoft uses the PASSME acronym for Non Functional Requirements (NFRs):  
Performance  
Availability  
Scalability  
Security  
Maintainability  
Extensibility

Reliability is a measure of how often the IT system fails to operate. As there are various ways a system can fail, there are usually different categories of failure depending on severity. The failure type of greatest concern, of course, is catastrophic failure, meaning that the system stops working altogether. Reliability is usually measured in terms of the mean (average) time between failures.

Availability is the measure of the proportion of time the IT system is likely to be operational over a given interval. It takes into account both the mean time between failures and the mean time to repair (a measure you did not mention). It is measured as a probability.

Resiliency is a measure of the IT system's ability to self-recover from problems that might otherwise cause it to fail, such as power outages or internal equipment failure (remember I said there are different classes of failure depending on severity). Resiliency is most often provided by redundancies and automatic re-routing of operations within a system. Note that system operation (such as processing speed) may be degraded until the problem is fixed, but there will be little or no interruption of service, and no data will be lost.

Fault-tolerance is the IT system's ability to self-detect and correct all types of problems. It is broader in scope than resilience in that it encompasses external sources of error such as faulty data transmission and user inputs.
