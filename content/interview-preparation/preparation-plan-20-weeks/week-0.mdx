# Week 0

## Instructions

**Technical homework**

Each **Sunday right after the technical class**, you will receive your technical homework on the topic you just learned in class. It is due on **the day before your next technical class** (**Saturday by 11:59pm in your time zone)**. It will include reading / video materials to learn the material and exercises to practice the assignments & learn how to use the content in interviews.

- **For the CodeSignal homework:**
    - The homework (or test) is active for 7 days. This means that it will expire in 7 days or on Sunday of that week whichever comes first.
    - As long as you don't hit submit, you can re-open the test link as many times as you want and it will resume where you left off
    - You can resubmit specific tasks if needed, but you can only submit the entire test once.
    - You can read, research and consult as many resources as possible to assist you solve the homework problems. Take this opportunity to learn. **But don't copy/share answers.**
    - You can choose whatever programming language you want. Python or Java tend to be fastest and easiest to follow for interviews. Others prefer C++ or C#, that's OK too. C is probably too slow for interview questions.
- **For the Leetcode homework:**
- You need to do at least 10 Leetcode questions every week. If you have extra time at the beginning of the course while it's easy, do more questions.
- Focus on easy and medium questions because that's what typically gets asked during interviews. If they're easy for you, practice answering them faster and writing cleaner code.
- If possible, focus on questions related to the topic for that week. We will suggest some for you. If the questions are locked, find other ones to answer.
    - When answering Leetcode questions, you should be aware of what data structures & algorithms you're using and why.
        - **For the Pramp interviews:**
- See instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHF5HRpX2gRwBl1Y2oSXM-6m0DpS-8pT-aD-_ccuPV0/edit?usp=sharing)

**Soft skills homework**

Each **Wednesday right after the soft skills training**, you will receive soft skills homework to prepare you for the next soft skills class. It is due 2 days before your next soft skills class (**Monday at 11:59pm in your time zone**).
