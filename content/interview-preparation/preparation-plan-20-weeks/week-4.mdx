## Homework (due Mon, Nov 30 EOD)

- Improve your homework answer from last week (“What's an example of a project you're proud of?”)
    - Label the old version of your answer “What's an example of a project you're proud of? - ORIGINAL” and the new version of your answer “What's an example of a project you're proud of? - REVISED WITH PARTNER” so that Manara's team can see both
    - Meet with your partner (same partner you had during class) to work on this.
        - Use this process:
            - Give feedback: What are they doing well? What can they do better?
            - Help them improve these parts:
                - STARR format
                - Why? How?
                - Business / project context & impact
            - Post this feedback in cohort5-collaboration so that other students can learn from it too. Be specific: what is 1 thing your partner did well & 1 thing she can do better?
    - Use “comments” in your Google doc to highlight specific parts of your story & what attributes it demonstrates ([like this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EU23-P86eFebHP1NFKb5VudUoVMPIsp89AeINi48ks/edit?usp=sharing))
        - Refer to Manara's [rubric for soft skills](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/126Rp7gnCoduqrMAFIIrMgJJxJxpZY4GOVNdWfXvSLGw/edit#gid=0) or the Amazon leadership principles.
        - Ask your partner for help!
- Answer the same question (“What's a project you're proud of?”)… with a different story!
    - You will often need multiple examples to answer the same question. So now it's time to come up with a second answer to the same question you answered last week!
    - Think of a different story & write it in your “Behavioral interview answers” document. Label it “What's an example of a project you're proud of? - OPTION 2”
- Practice speaking your answers aloud
    - Practice whichever story you want (or both!)
    - Make sure it sounds natural, not memorized (even though you've been practicing)
    - Be prepared to share your answer in front of the group on Wednesday!
