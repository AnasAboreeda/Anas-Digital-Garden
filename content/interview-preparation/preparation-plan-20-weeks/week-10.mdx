## Homework (due Tue, Jan 12 EOD)

- Create a subfolder in your folder called “Resume”
    - All of your resume drafts & related work should go in this folder
- Create a brainstorm document
    - In that folder, create a Google document you'll call “Resume brainstorm”
    - In it, write down all of your ideas regarding what you could potentially include in your resume
        - Include awards, projects, etc
        - Include long detailed descriptions of each one
    - Your brainstorm document should be ~ 2 pages long
    - The objective of having this is to give your mentor content that they can help you shape into a resume. It's a lot easier for them to start with a lot of content and present it concisely, than for them to get a half-page resume and figure out how to make it longer for you.
- Create your Google-style resume first draft
    - Create a Google doc named “First Name Last Name - FAANG resume V1”
    - Create your resume first draft using [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-MKDDWXPJNMY2_gs_Xpo2nDEGa21YqF4yjRJ9JfIyE/edit)
- Get help from a classmate
