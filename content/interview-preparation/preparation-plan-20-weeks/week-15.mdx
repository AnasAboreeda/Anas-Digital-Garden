# Week 15

## WEEK #15: SOFT SKILLS: Behavioral interviews: Amazon continued

## Pre-reading (due Tue, Feb 16)

    2. [Dan Croiter on YouTube: “Best Answer: What's your favorite Amazon leadership principle?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLnYa51tNEE)”
    3. [Interview Genie: How to answer questions about Amazon leadership principle “Customer Obsession”](https://interviewgenie.com/blog-1/2017/11/28/how-to-answer-amazon-leadership-principle-customer-obsession-interview-questions)
