# Week 2

## WEEK #2 SOFT SKILLS: Intro to behavioral interviews

## Assigned Reading & Videos (due Tue, Nov 17 EOD)

- Read [the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rCIladYt33WmkTU4GGPf4gZONTJLTFW0FncFmnbjTDI/edit?usp=sharing) we were supposed to have on Nov 11. We'll go through it quickly this week so we don't fall behind.

## Homework (due Tue, Nov 17 EOD)

- In your homework folder
    - Edit the name of the file from last week so it is called “Soft skills homework #1 - First name last name”
    - Add a new file for this week called “Soft skills homework #2 - First name last name.” Do the homework this week in that file.
- Think about a situation you faced recently that bothered you - at work, school, home, etc. Gather your thoughts, then write down how you would share that feedback to that person. Remember to consider:
1. Data / what you observed
2. Your feelings, your assumptions, and/or the impact it had
3. Your request

    1. An important takeaway you learned from the book *Clean Code* or from the exercise you did with a buddy
