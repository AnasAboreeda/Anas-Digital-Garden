# 03 Algorithm and Data Structure

- Solve a problem in Java: [https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)
- FizzBuzz problem:
    - "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
- Write code on the whiteboard that could take user input and determine if it is a palindrome.

	```javascript
		function is_palindrome(input) { return (input === input.split('').reverse().join('')); }
	```

- Take two arrays and compare them to find duplicates. Only list each duplicate once.
- Implement a SortedMap in JavaScript
- In one hour, implement a web service that can read a file > 10GB and store all the distinct words in it and the number of times they occur and do it in O(N) or less complexity. Then write all the code on the client (browser) side to allow anyone to search for all words beginning with what the user inputs, uses AJAX to pull the results into the page, and deals with a lot of results with pagination or infinite scrolling of some type.
- Outline how you would implement a chess game in a language of your choice.
- How would you implement integer division if your language did not offer it.
- How would you reverse a linked list?

## Front End

- Write a tool that will display a todo list that is pulled from a database. When an item is checked off the list, have some action happen to indicate that item is done.
- Make an accordion where when clicked, text expands from it and when another item is clicked, the first one collapses and the second one expands.
- How would you make this markup more accessible for a visually impaired person? Hearing impaired? How about a person on a slow network?
- Vertically and horizontally center an element on the screen using css.
- Write a JS code to travers the DOM and find an element with a specified class name
- A simple CSS positioning question that starts with an independent widget (like a star rating widget)
