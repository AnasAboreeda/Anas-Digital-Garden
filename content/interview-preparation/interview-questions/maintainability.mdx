# Maintainability

## Testing

- How do you do testing? And what do you think about this? How would you improve QA?
- What is testing pyramid?
- How to build a good unit or integration test.
- Test coverage.
- What's a stub? Name a use case.
	- Stubs are functions/programs that simulate the behaviours of components/modules. Stubs provide canned answers to function calls made during test cases. Also, you can assert on with what these stubs were called.
