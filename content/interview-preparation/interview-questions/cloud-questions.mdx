# Cloud Questions

1. If we need to download millions of files/keys from Aws S3, how can we speedup the process?
2. What happens if Cloudformation stack updates failed? How to limit resources creation based on values?
3. How can you send a Large message to AWS SQS (i.e. 1GB)?
4. You have created a Lambda function that typically will take around 1 hour to process some data. The code works fine when you run it locally on your machine, but when you invoke the Lambda function it fails with a "timeout" error after 3 seconds. What should you do?

- Configure your Lambda's timeout to 25 minutes
- Configure your Lambda's memory to 10 GB
- Run your code somewhere else (e.g., EC2 instance)

1. A Lambda function that's invoked asynchronously, fails to process from time to time after 3 retries. To troubleshoot the issue, you would like to collect and analyze these events later on. What is the best practice you can do?

- Add logging statements for all events in your Lambda function, then filter CloudWatch Logs
- Invoke your function synchronously
- Add A Dead Letter Queue(DLQ) to send messages to SQS
- Add A Dead Letter Queue(DLQ) to send messages to SNS

1. What this IAM policy is for

```java
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "example-ID",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "IAM Policy Example",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": [
                "SQS:SendMessage"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:230521890328:EVCAFE",
            "Condition": {
                "ArnLike": {
                    "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:*:*:evcafe"
                },
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:SourceAccount": "230521890328"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
