# Html && Css

- What is the importance of CSS selectors? Where do you use them?
	- CSS selectors are the part of a CSS rule set that actually selects the content you want to style.
	- Also, selectors are being processed from right to left so you should place the most specific attribute on the right and most generic one on the left (for example, li .my-class). ID selector (#) is a bit faster than class selector (.) but not significantly. Type selector ([]) and descendant selector (ul li) on the other hand are far slower than any of the two (but similar in performance to one another).
