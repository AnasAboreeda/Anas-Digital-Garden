## Q: Consider the following JavaScript Code

```javascript
console.log("first")
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("second")
}, 0)
console.log("third")
```

The output will be:

    first
    third
    second

Assuming that this is the desired behavior, and that we are using Node.js version 0.10 or higher, how else might we write this code?

### Answer

Node.js version 0.10 introduced `setImmediate`, which is equivalent to `setTimeout(fn, 0)`, but with some slight advantages.

`setTimeout(fn, delay)` calls the given callback fn after the given delay has ellapsed (in milliseconds). However, the callback is not executed immediately at this time, but added to the function queue so that it is executed as soon as possible, after all the currently executing and currently queued event handlers have completed. Setting the delay to 0 adds the callback to the queue immediately so that it is executed as soon as all currently-queued functions are finished.

`setImmediate(fn)` achieves the same effect, except that it doesn't use the queue of functions. Instead, it checks the queue of I/O event handlers. If all I/O events in the current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback. It queues them immediately after the last I/O handler somewhat like process.nextTick. This is faster than `setTimeout(fn, 0)`.

So, the above code can be written in Node as:

```javaScript
console.log("first");
setImmediate(function(){
    console.log("second");
});
console.log("third");
```

### Q: what is the Preferred Method of Resolving Unhandled Exceptions in Node.js?

#### Answer

Unhandled exceptions in Node.js can be caught at the Process level by attaching a handler for uncaughtException event.

```javaScript
process.on('uncaughtException', function(err) {
  console.log('Caught exception: ' + err);
});
```

However, uncaughtException is a very crude mechanism for exception handling and may be removed from Node.js in the future. An exception that has bubbled all the way up to the Process level means that your application, and Node.js may be in an undefined state, and the only sensible approach would be to restart everything.

The preferred way is to add another layer between your application and the Node.js process which is called the domain.

Domains provide a way to handle multiple different I/O operations as a single group. So, by having your application, or part of it, running in a separate domain, you can safely handle exceptions at the domain level, before they reach the Process level.

## Javascript

- What is callback hell? How do you prevent/fix callback hell?
- What is a “closure” in JavaScript?
  - A closure is an inner function that has access to the variables in the outer (enclosing) function's scope chain. The closure has access to variables in three scopes; specifically: (1) variable in its own scope, (2) variables in the enclosing function's scope, and (3) global variables.
- Scope and hoisting
  - What will you see in the console for the following example ?
  - Primitive type (string, number, etc.) are passed by value and objects are passed by reference. If you change a property of the passed object, the change will be affected. However, you assign a new object to the passed object, the changes will not be reflected.
- explain how javascript event loop works. <http://latentflip.com/loupe/>

## Node.JS

- What are the features of Node.js?
  - Node.js is a single-threaded but highly scalable system that utilizes JavaScript as its scripting language. It uses asynchronous, event-driven I/O instead of separate processes or threads. It is able to achieve high output via single-threaded event loop and non-blocking I/O.
- What are “streams” in Node.js? Explain the different types of streams present in Node.js.
- How does Node.js support multi-processor platforms, and does it fully utilize all processor resources?
  - Since Node.js is by default a single thread application, it will run on a single processor core and will not take full advantage of multiple core resources. However, Node.js provides support for deployment on multiple-core systems, to take greater advantage of the hardware. The Cluster module is one of the core Node.js modules and it allows running multiple Node.js worker processes that will share the same port.
- What is the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate() ?
  - The difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate() is that process.nextTick() defers the execution of an action till the next pass around the event loop or it simply calls the callback function once the ongoing execution of the event loop is finished whereas setImmediate() executes a callback on the next cycle of the event loop and it gives back to the event loop for executing any I/O operations.
- How Node.js overcomes the problem of blocking of I/O operations?
  - Node.js solves this problem by putting the event based model at its core, using an event loop instead of threads.
- Why `npm shrinkwrap` is useful?
  - This command locks down the versions of a package's dependencies so that you can control exactly which versions of each dependency will be used when your package is installed.
  - It is useful when you are deploying your Node.js applications - with it you can be sure which versions of your dependencies are going to be deployed.

## Microservices

- What are the advantages of microservices?
- What are the characteristics of Microservices?
  - Essential messaging frameworks
  - Decentralized Governance
  - Easy Infrastructure automation
  - Design for failure
  - Infrastructure automation
- What Is CQRS?
  - CQRS stands for Command, Query, Responsibility, and Segregation. In CQRS, we divide our read and write operations into two parts one is Command side and another one is Query side. command side handles create, update, and delete. basically command side is used to when data changes and query side is used to get data from the database by executing the query against one or more materialized view.
- When Do We Use CQRS?
  - When there are multiple operations are performed in parallel on the same data.
  - Scenarios when the number of the read operation is higher than the write operation in this situation we need horizontal scaling. In this type of situation, we prefer CQRS.
  - Situations when one team of developers can focus on the write side and another team of developers can focus on the read side and user interface.
- Benefits of CQRS
  - The main and most useful feature of CQRS is that we can do independently scaling ie both horizontal and vertical.
  - By using CQRS it is very easy to maintain the security of the database ie. because there are some people who have only read rights and some people who have only write rights and some of the people have both read and write rights. so, In CQRS it 's very easy to maintain security.
  - CQRS is also helping us to maintain consistency throughout the independent systems.
  - CQRS also help in a situation when the read side is available in case of failure if your write side is down then you can read the last update in the database.
- When CQRS Is Not Recommend
  - When the domain or the business rules are simple.
  - Where a simple crud style user interface and the related data access operation are sufficient.
  - When there is less amount of read and write operations are performed and the database is not too large.
  - When our database is not distributed.
- What is Docker Swarm?
  - Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker host. Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts.  
    Behavioural questions:
- Tell me about a time when you were faced with a problem that had a number of possible solutions. What was the problem and how did you determine the course of action? What was the outcome of that choice?
- When have you ever taken a risk, made a mistake or failed? How did you respond and how did you learn from that experience?
- Describe a time when you took the lead on a project
- What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or encourage collaboration during a particular project?
- How have you leveraged data to develop a strategy?

## Sql

- What is the difference between timestamp and datetime data types
  - One of the main differences between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP is that MySQL converts TIMESTAMP values from the current time zone to UTC for storage, and back from UTC to the current time zone for retrieval. It does not do so for DATETIME values.

## Redis

- What are Redis Data Types?
  - Strings - Hashes - Lists - Sets - Sorted Sets

## Elastic search

- Update 10M documents with a new field called \_updatedAt.
- Which language used for scripts in Elastic search?
- Q. Does ElasticSearch have a schema ?
  - Yes, ElasticSeach can have mappings which can be used to enforce schema on documents.
- Q.What is a replica in ElasticSearch ?
  - Each shard in ElasticSearch has 2 copy of the shard. These copies are called replicas. They serve the purpose of high-availability and fault-tolerance.

## Technical Proplems

- FizzBuzz problem:

- What are the advantages that Containerization provides over virtualization?  
  Below are the advantages of containerization over virtualization:  
  Containers provide real-time provisioning and scalability but VMs provide slow provisioning  
  Containers are lightweight when compared to VMs  
  VMs have limited performance when compared to containers  
  Containers have better resource utilization compared to VMs

- Discuss your experience building bridges between IT Ops, QA and development.  
  DevOps is all about effective communication and collaboration. I've been able to deal with production issues from the development and operations sides, effectively straddling the two worlds. I'm less interested in finding blame or playing the hero than I am with ensuring that all of the moving parts come together.

- What is the one most important thing DevOps helps do?  
  The most important thing DevOps helps do is to get the changes into production as quickly as possible while minimizing risks in software quality assurance and compliance. That is the primary objective of DevOps. However, there are many other positive side-effects to DevOps. For example, clearer communication and better working relationships between teams which creates a less stressful working environment.

- What testing is necessary to ensure that a new service is ready for production?  
  DevOps is all about continuous testing throughout the process, starting with development through to production. Everyone shares the testing responsibility. This ensures that developers are delivering code that doesn't have any errors and is of high quality, and it also helps everyone leverage their time most effectively.

- What's a PTR in DNS?  
  Pointer records are used to map a network interface (IP) to a host name. These are primarily used for reverse DNS. Reverse DNS is setup very similar to how normal (forward) DNS is setup. When you delegate the DNS forward, the owner of the domain tells the registrar to let your domain use specific name servers.

- Describe two-factor authentication?  
  Two-factor authentication is a security process in which the user provides two means of identification from separate categories of credentials; one is typically a physical token, such as a card, and the other is typically something memorized, such as a security code.

- How would you prepare for a migration?  
  Tips to answer: This question evaluates your experience of real projects with all the awkwardness and complexity they bring. Include terms like cut-over, dress rehearsals, roll-back and roll-forward, DNS solutions, feature toggles, branch by abstraction, and automation in your answer. Developing greenfield systems with little or no existing technology in place is always easier than having to deal with legacy components and configuration. As a candidate if you appreciate that any interesting software system will in effect be under constant migration, you will appear suitable for the role.

- Are you familiar with just Linux or have you worked with Windows environments as well?  
  Tips to answer: Demonstrate as much as you can, a clear understanding of both the environments including the key tools.

- How can you reduce load time of a dynamic website?  
  Tips to answer: Talk about Webpage optimization, cached web pages, quality web hosting , compressed text files, Apache fine tuning.

- Describe your experience implementing continuous deployment?  
  Tips to answer: Answer with a comprehensive list of all the tools that you used. Include inferences of the challenges you faced and how you tackled them.

- How would you ensure traceability?  
  Tips to answer: This question probes your attitude to metrics, logging, transaction journeys, and reporting. You should be able to identify that metric, monitoring and logging needs to be a core part of the software system, and that without them, the software is essentially not going to be able to appear maintained and diagnosed. Include words like SysLog, Splunk, error tracking, Nagios, SCOM, Avicode in your answer.

- What problems did you face and how did you solve them in a way that met the team's goals?  
  Tips to answer: This questions aims to find out how much you can handle stress and non-conformity at work. Talk about your leadership skills to handle and motivate the team to solve problems together.Talk about CI, release management and other tools to keep interdisciplinary projects on track.

What are the three principles that Redux follows?

1. Single source of truth: The state of the entire application is stored in an object/ state tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
2. State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to trigger an action. An action is a plain JS object describing the change. Just like state is the minimal representation of data, the action is the minimal representation of the change to that data.
3. Changes are made with pure functions: In order to specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you need pure functions. Pure functions are those whose return value depends solely on the values of their arguments.
