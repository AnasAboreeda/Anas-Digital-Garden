# General Tech

## General Tech

- In as much detail as you can, tell us what happens when you hit the Enter key to navigate to a domain in a web browser.
- What are the mean characteristics of functional programming? [https://goo.gl/LRiXSB](https://goo.gl/LRiXSB)
    - Pure functions
    - Function composition
    - Avoid shared state
    - Avoid mutating state
    - Avoid side effects
- What is the DRY principle? (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- What tools do you use to find a performance bug in a website?
- What are the differences of using HTTP/2 as opposed to HTTP 1.1?
    - HTTP/2 provides decreased latency to improve page load speed by supporting:
        - Data compression of HTTP headers
        - Server push technologies
        - Loading of page elements in parallel over a single TCP connection
        - Prioritization of requests
        - An important operational benefit of HTTP/2 is that it avoids the head-of-line blocking problem in HTTP 1.
- Pretend I'm a 10 years old. Can you explain to me what ________ is in plain English?
    - microservice architecture, service mesh, istio, buffers, CQRS, â€¦

- SOLID principles - describe each of them
- Performance optimisation.
- SSR.
- Logging / Error handling.
- Monitoring.
- Tell me about the factors that determine which technologies you'll use on a project.
	- Time to Market.
	- 2: Long-term Code Maintainability.

		- The software should make effective use of *storage* space and executive command as per desired *timing* requirements.
	- **Usability:** It refers to the extent to which the software can be used with ease. the amount of effort or time required to learn how to use the software.
		- Understandability
		- Learnability
		- Operability
	- **Maintainability:** It refers to the ease with which the modifications can be made in a software system to extend its functionality, improve its performance, or correct errors
		- Testability
		- Stability
		- Changability
		- Operability
	- **Portability:** A set of attributes that bears on the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another, without or minimum changes.
