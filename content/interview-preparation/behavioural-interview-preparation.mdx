# Behavioural Interview Preparation

# Dev Lead and Managers

Strong coding skills are almost always required for dev lead positions and often for management positions as well. If you'll be coding on the job, make sure to be very strong with coding and algorithms-just like a dev would be. Google, in particular, holds managers to high standards when it comes to coding.

In addition, prepare to be examined for skills in the following areas:

## Teamwork I Leadership

 Anyone in a management-like role needs to be able to both lead and work with people. You will be examined implicitly and explicitly in these areas. Explicit evaluation will come in the form of asking you how you handled prior situations, such as when you disagreed with a manager. The implicit evaluation comes in the form of your interviewers watching how you interact with them. If you come off as too arrogant or too passive, your interviewer may feel you aren't great as a manager.

## Prioritization

Managers are often faced with tricky issues, such as how to make sure a team meets a tough deadline. Your interviewers will want to see that you can prioritize a project appropriately, cutting the less important aspects. Prioritization means asking the right questions to understand what is critical and what you can reasonably expect to accomplish.

## Communication

Managers need to communicate with people both above and below them, and potentially with customers and other much less technical people. Interviewers will look to see that you can communicate at many levels and that you can do so in a way that is friendly and engaging. This is, in some ways, an evaluation of your personality.

## "Getting Things Done"

Perhaps the most important thing that a manager can do is be a person who "gets things done:'This means striking the right balance between preparing for a project and actually implementing it. You need to understand how to structure a project and how to motivate people so you can accomplish the team's goals.

## Checklist

- Choose a compelling project that highlights your technical know-how
- e.g., a project with technical challenges you overcame; compelling reasons you're proud of it besides "It was my first time working with X language"
- Explain the context of the project
- Name the technologies you used
- Identify the specific actions you took on the project and why you approached them the way you did
- Share at least one major technical decision you made
- Share the results of the project (preferably the business impact)
- Share thoughtful learnings/reflections
- Explain the technical jargon you used

Before I joined the university, I was accepted into training at Google to develop Android applications. Meanwhile, I noticed the challenges and struggles of Egypt's tourism sector, so I thought of promoting tourist places through a new method, which is virtual reality. I started collecting some information about the tourist areas and filmed some of them with a 360-degree camera with the help of a photographer.

But during the development of the application, there was a problem that virtual reality was not supported on most phones in 2016.

So I got an idea to make a new feature to move the image three-sixty degrees using touch gestures on the screen for old phones that do not support gyroscope sensors for virtual reality, and I contributed to some open-source projects that use Google cardboard VR SDK.  
And I succeeded in supporting this feature, especially on some Samsung phones, which were not supported by the VR SDK at that time.

It became the first Egyptian virtual reality application for tourism and won second place in the Google startup competition with thousands of active users.  
Then the app was selected to represent Egypt in the ALECSO International competition in Tunisia in the tourism category and I won first place in the MENA region.  
After that, I cooperated with one of the tourism companies in Luxor city and they provided some photos of the Pharaonic royal tombs, as most of them are not available to visit now, so the application had more than 100 different places in Egypt.

Even though several years have passed since, this app still has a lot of active users and I am still proud of it.

# “Project you're proud of #2” & follow up questions

While I was studying at the university, the Coronavirus crisis occurred, and the entire study turned online, But the university system was not ready to completely transform the study online. And it has a lot of problems in terms of attending lectures or downloading the required files, different dates of exams, no alerts, and lack of communication between students and professors.

So I started looking for a way to improve the current situation and found that the university uses the Moodle system, which is open source so I thought of creating an application with a simple design that would be an alternative to the website and to organize access to the files of each subject separately and send alerts to the user before the dates of lectures and exams. After that, I created the first version of the app within one week, and I sent it to some of my friends at the university to test it, I was surprised that they liked it very much and they sent it to their friends, and within just a few days, the application was used by more than half of the university students. Then I created a new version of the application that has the ability to exchange messages directly with the teacher.

After that, I started making some online training sessions with my colleagues at the university to help them and explain how to create a similar application and how to use the API service with some other techniques like scraping and feeds to get the required data from the site.

# “Conflict You've faced”

When I was studying at the Faculty of Engineering, we were assigned to a project to design a small ship and make some simulations in order to improve the design.  
So the team leader asked us to use the Solidworks program, But I had recently been looking at some new programs for 3D design and I suggested to him to use the NAPA program because it supports some new features.

But the team leader had no experience working with NAPA so he didn't feel comfortable using it. And I felt that I needed to better explain my perspective. So I searched more about the new program and followed some tutorials about its use in 3D design and summarized the new features, and then held a meeting with the engineer to explain the details and to show him exactly how Solidworks will not work because we use a new ship model which is not compatible with this version. This demonstration convinced the engineer to use my suggested program.

So I held a session with my teammates to explain the basics of the program and we were able to successfully complete the new design and it was the best project in the department.

What I learned from this situation is that the best way to make a proposal is to always research first and then use this data to make a clear comparison between the two different opinions, which will make the choice easier.

# “Strengths & Weaknesses”

I believe that my greatest strength is that I am a quick learner and self-motivated, So I always have the ability to organize and plan how to learn something new and I write down lists and keep a checklist to ensure that I'm on the right track and I focus 100% on what I am learning, which gives me the ability to pick it up quickly. Also one of the best ways I've tried is to share this new information with others.  
For example, when I was attending any training or learning something new, I would make a session with my colleagues and explain what I learned to them, which helped me to remember this information and also sometimes another friend who has experience in the same thing adds some more info to me.

About my Weakness, I can be quite self critical. I fall into a pattern of thinking, Maybe I could have done better, even when I do well and the project is successful. This leads to negative self-talk and eventual burnout.  
Currently, I am learning to celebrate the little achievements and express gratitude for the other's efforts and how each person including me benefits our team.  
One specific example was last year when I was working on the graduation project, and it was an application that used an AI model to colorize black and white photos, and the time available was only enough for the main features in the app, so I felt that I could do more and add more features, but then I realized that I did a really good application and got an A in the project so I should feel some pride in getting the job done on time.

# “Tell Me about yourself”

My name is Amr Muhammad, from Egypt.

After high school, I started studying marine engineering and ship architecture at the Faculty of Engineering Alexandria University, But I discovered programming And then I realized that this is what I really wanted, so I decided to leave the university and enroll in the Faculty of Computer Studies at the Open University. Now I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and held the top grades in the class.

While studying, I worked as a freelancer Android developer using Java and Kotlin and I have many successful applications on Google Play store. And I got training from Google and training from the Egyptian Ministry of Communications in developing Android applications, In addition to winning second place in the Google competition for startups, And my app was selected to represent Egypt in the ALECSO International competition in Tunisia in the tourism category and I won first place in the MENA region.

After graduating, I started improving my skills in web development using Javascript and I got an internship in BackEnd track using C# and ASP.NET Core.

So in brief I love learning new technologies and I'm looking to start my career in a company where I can be a part of a team.

Note to Amr
