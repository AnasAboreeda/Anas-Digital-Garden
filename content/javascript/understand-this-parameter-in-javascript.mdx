# 'this' Parameter in JavaScript

## Q: how to Get the Actual Value of the Parameter `this`?

### Answer

- `this` will always take the value of the appearing on the left side of the `.`

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = { r: "r" },
  g = "g",
  b = "b"

r.method = fn

r.method(g, b) // this will log => r, g, b
```

- If there is no `.` in method call `this` will refer to the `global` object

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b"

fn(g, b) // this will log => <global> , g, b
```

- What if we want to define `this` ourselves without making the method as a property of another object
  - **We can do that by using `call` method**

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b"

fn.call(r, g, b) // this will log => r, g, b
```

- Even we can overwrite the default `.` rule to pass a custom object to `this` to refer to using `call` method like that

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b",
  y = "y"

r.method = fn

r.method.call(y, g, b) // this will log => y, g, b
```

- what will happen When some function is passed as a parameter to another function `this`

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b",
  y = "y"

setTimeout(fn, 100) // this will log => <global>, undefined, undefined
```

- consider also this example
  - The only moment that matter is when the function get invoked not when it is passed, So this will also print  
    out `global` not `r`

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b",
  y = "y"

r.method = fn

setTimeout(r.method, 100) // this will also log => <global>, undefined, undefined
```

- Now let's try this example, `this` will behave like normal in such case as the calling time is what we are caring of

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b",
  y = "y"

r.method = fn

setTimeout(function () {
  r.method(g, b)
}, 100) // this will log => r, g, b
```

- For the last example we can see new object empty object created in case we used `new` with our call

```javascript
var fn = function (one, two) {
  console.log(this, one, two)
}

var r = {},
  g = "g",
  b = "b"

r.method = fn

new r.method(g, b) // this will log => {}, g, b
```
