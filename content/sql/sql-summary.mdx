## Basic Commands

| Statement | How to Use It               | Other Details                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| SELECT    | SELECT Col1, Col2,…| Provide the columns you want                          |
| FROM      | FROM Table                  | Provide the table where the columns exist             |
| LIMIT     | LIMIT 10                    | Limits based number of rows returned                  |
| ORDER BY  | ORDER BY Col                | Orders table based on the column. Used with DESC.     |
| WHERE     | WHERE Col > 5               | A conditional statement to filter your results        |
| LIKE      | WHERE Col LIKE '%me%'       | Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text |
| IN        | WHERE Col IN ('Y', 'N')     | A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'      |
| NOT       | WHERE Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N') | NOT is frequently used with LIKE and IN               |
| AND       | WHERE Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3 | Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true |
| OR        | WHERE Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3  | Filter rows where at least one condition must be true |
| BETWEEN   | WHERE Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5   | Often easier syntax than using an AND                 |

## Joins

The three **JOIN** statements you are most likely to use are:

1. **JOIN** - an **INNER JOIN** that only pulls data that exists in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN** - pulls all the data that exists in both tables, as well as all of the rows from the table in the **FROM** even if they do not exist in the **JOIN** statement.
3. **RIGHT JOIN** - pulls all the data that exists in both tables, as well as all of the rows from the table in the **JOIN** even if they do not exist in the **FROM** statement.

```SQL
SELECT c.countryid, c.countryName, s.stateName
FROM Country c
LEFT JOIN State s
ON c.countryid = s.countryid;
```

### Cross Join

- The SQL CROSS JOIN produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if no WHERE clause is used along with CROSS JOIN.This kind of result is called as **Cartesian Product**.
- If WHERE clause is used with CROSS JOIN, it functions like an INNER JOIN.

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;


SELECT foods.item_name,foods.item_unit,
company.company_name,company.company_city
FROM foods
CROSS JOIN company;


SELECT foods.item_name,foods.item_unit,
company.company_name,company.company_city
FROM foods,company;

```

### Sql Self Join

- A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

```SQL
SELECT _column_name(s)_
FROM _table1 T1, table1 T2_
WHERE _condition_;
```

 - The following SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:

```SQL
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;
```

## Union Operator

The `UNION` operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more `SELECT` statements.

- Every `SELECT` statement within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
- The columns must also have similar data types
- The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order

```SQL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

### Union All Syntax

The `UNION` operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow duplicate values, use `UNION ALL`:

```SQL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

```SQL
SELECT City, Country FROM Customers
WHERE Country='Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country FROM Suppliers
WHERE Country='Germany'
ORDER BY City;
```

- Notice the "AS Type" above - it is an alias. [SQL Aliases](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp) are used to give a table or a column a temporary name.
- An alias only exists for the duration of the query.
- So, here we have created a temporary column named "Type", that list whether the contact person is a "Customer" or a "Supplier".

```SQL
SELECT 'Customer' AS Type, ContactName, City, Country
FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT 'Supplier', ContactName, City, Country
FROM Suppliers;
```

## Aggregates

### Count

- counting the number of rows in a particular column.

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tutorial;
```

- provide a count of all of rows in which the `high` column **is not null**.

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(high) FROM tutorial;
```

### Sum

- totals the values in a given column
- You don't need to worry as much about the presence of nulls with `SUM` as you would with `COUNT`, as `SUM` treats nulls as 0.

```SQL
SELECT SUM(volume) FROM tutorial
```

### Min & Max

- return the lowest and highest values in a particular column.
- They're similar to COUNT in that they can be used on non-numerical columns.
- Depending on the column type, `MIN` will return the lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as close alphabetically to "A" as possible.
- As you might suspect, `MAX` does the opposite—it returns the highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest alphabetically to "Z."

```SQL
SELECT
	MIN(volume) AS min_volume,
	MAX(volume) AS max_volume
FROM tutorial
```

## Normalization

### First Normal Form (1NF)

1. Single valued columns (each column should have atomic value, no multiple values)
2. Column domain (for any column) should not change.
3. Unique names for columns.
4. Order (of rows/columns) does not matter.
5. No duplicate records (every record has a primary key).

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

For a table to be in second normal form, the following 2 conditions must be met:

1. The table should be in the first normal form.
2. The primary key of the table should have exactly 1 column. (OR) No non-prime column that is not a part of primary key should be functionally dependent on any proper subset of a candidate key. In other words, there should be No partial dependency (no column should depend on the part of the primary key).

#### The Concept of a Functional Dependency on a Table

```
>Functional dependency: Denoted with A => B.
 A and B are columns of a table. An oversimplified explanation of Function dependency is as follows.
If I know a value in column A then I for sure know the value in column B but the reverse is not true.
E.g. A is student number and B is student name.
I can tell the name of the student from student number, but
I cannot tell the student number from the name because there could be multiple students with the same name.
```

- Column A is said to be functionally dependent on column B if changing the value of A may require a change in the value of B.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

- No transitive dependency (i.e. no column should depend on non-key column).

### Boyce-codd Normal Form (BCNF)

The Boyce-Codd Normal form is a stronger generalization of the third normal form. A table is in Boyce-Codd Normal form if and only if at least one of the following conditions are met for each functional dependency A → B:

- A is a superkey
- It is a trivial functional dependency.

### Fourth Normal Form 4NF (3NF + rule)

- No multi-value dependency.
