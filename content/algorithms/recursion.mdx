# Recursion

## Introduction

Recursion is one of the most important concepts in computer science. Simply speaking, recursion is the process of a function calling itself.

```java
//P.S.  (Not a good implemintation we should use memoization with it)

class Solution{
 public static int factorial(int n) {
       if (n <= 1) { // BASE CASE / exit
          return 1;
       }

      return n * factorial(n - 1);// RECURSIVE CALL

    }

    // Driver code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 0);
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 1);
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 2);
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 5);
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 7);
        System.out.println("Factorial :" + 12);
    }
}
```

This example highlights the key components in writing a correct recursive function:

1. **Base case/exit**, e.g. Carly doesn’t call anyone else. She just says yes and hangs up.
2. **Recursive call**, e.g. calling the function itself with different arguments, e.g. Ben calling Sheldon.

## Recursion and stack

How does the computer accomplish the feat of calling a function itself?

The answer is quite simple: it uses a stack behind the scene to keep track of where things are.

For this particular problem, the factorial recursive function roughly translates to this when executed:

```python
def factorial_stack(n):
    stack = []
    # push each call to a stack
    # top of the stack is the base case
    while n > 0:
        stack.append(n)
        n -= 1

    res = 1
    # pop and use return value until stack is empty
    while stack is not None:
        res *= stack.pop()

    return res

```

A computer’s internal stack is called **“call stack”**, and the data it pushes onto a call stack are called “stack frames”.

Strictly speaking, stack frames on a call stack represent the function you are calling and its arguments.
