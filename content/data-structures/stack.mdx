# Stack

- Stacks can be implemented with either an array or a linked list.
- Each stack operation is O(1): Push, Pop, Top, Empty.
- Stacks are occasionally known as LIFO queues.

## Mean Features

- **Stack / LIFO**: Abstract data type with the following operations:
  - Push(Key): adds key to collection
  - Key Top(): returns most recently-added key
  - Key Pop(): removes and returns most recently-added key
  - Boolean Empty(): are there any elements?
